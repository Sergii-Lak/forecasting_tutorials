Tutorials designed for Concordia students created in 2019-2020

If you would like to learn how to use SAS EG for business forecasting purposes, then you may find these materials useful. Here you will find PDF files with step-by-step instructions on how to run forecasting models in SAS EG, how to explore, partition data, calculate errors, plot data and so on. 

If you wish to replicate the tutorials, then you will need these datasets:
1) Bike sharing: https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset?select=day.csv
2) Amtrak data: https://www.dataminingbook.com/book/r-edition (Datasets Download (R Edition))
To download the files, you need to register first.
